#add in abortion policy df

combined_df <- left_join(anes_vote_df, abortion_policy_df, by = c("STATE_ABV"))
#expecting just a few more columns to be added to above 

write.csv(combined_df, file ="combined_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```


#Analysis
get summary stats by state and year, save as new df
use new df above in regression with unit-level being state
this will only be up to 2020
DID would be trying to get a bit of insight to see if the trend would be effected by Dobbs
##Exploratory regression 
##Differences-in-differences 

```{r}
#create a variable with the year of "treatment" which is 2022
df$time = ifelse(df$YEAR >= 2022, 1, 0)

#create interaction between time and the treated variable= changed 
df$did = df$time * df$Changed

#Estimating the DID estimator
didreg = lm(VEP ~ Changed + time + did, data = df)
summary(didreg)

```
 The coefficient for ‘did’ is the differences-in-differences
estimator, not significant in this case, but a positive direction. 

```{r}
didreg1 = lm(VEP ~ Changed*time, data = df)
summary(didreg1)
```
The coefficient for ‘treated#time’ is the differences-indifferences estimator 
(did in last estimate). Still not significant. 

```{r}
#simple model 
reg = lm(VEP ~ Changed, data = df)
summary(reg)
```
still not significant

#some exploratory graphs

```{r}
#code from https://lfoswald.github.io/2021-spring-stats2/materials/session-8/08-online-tutorial/
df %>%
mutate(Changed = ifelse(Changed == 1, "Treated (D=1)", "Untreated (D=0)")) %>%
group_by(time, Changed) %>% # group to extract means of each group at each time
mutate(group_mean = mean(VEP)) %>% # extract means of each group at each time
ggplot(., aes(x = VEP, fill = factor(Changed))) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(name = " ", # changes to fill dimension
                     values = c("#cc0055", "#a7a8aa"),
                     labels = c("Treatment", "Control")) +
  facet_grid(Changed~time) + # we specify the matrix (treatment and period)
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = group_mean), linetype = "longdash") + # add vertical line with the mean
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "VEP",
       y = "Density")
```
```{r}
#code from https://lfoswald.github.io/2021-spring-stats2/materials/session-8/08-online-tutorial/
df %>%
group_by(time, Changed) %>% # group to extract means of each group at each time
mutate(group_mean = mean(VEP)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = time, y = group_mean, color = factor(Changed))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(x = time, y = group_mean)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1)) +
  scale_color_manual(name = " ", # changes to color dimension
                     values = c("#a7a8aa", "#cc0055"),
                     labels = c("Control", "Treatment")) +
  labs(x = "Time periods", y = "VEP", color = "Treatment group")+
  theme_minimal() 
```
Would see seperate lines with different slopes if they were different.
