In this analysis, we sought to explore the following research question: "does the imposition
of restrictive policies regarding reproductive bodily autonomy affect political participation?" We
used abortion access as an indicator for bodily autonomy and voter turnout in midterm
elections as a measure of political participation, and hypothesized that limiting access to abortions
would increase voter turnout. This inquiry delved into the nuanced interaction between evolving
abortion policy and its impact on political participation in the post-Dobbs era.


A difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis was used to investigate the correlation between restrictive 
reproductive policies and political engagement, comparing states with unchanged abortion laws to 
those with increased restrictions post-Dobbs. This approach allows for causal inferences by 
establishing treated and control groups, crucial for isolating the effects of policy changes from 
temporal trends. 

Additionally, the analysis spans two DiD models covering midterm elections from 1982 to 2022 and 
elections from 2010 to 2022, offering comprehensive insights into long-term trends and recent policy 
dynamics' immediate implications on political participation. Alongside DiD, a regression model 
correlating 2022 voter turnout rates with state abortion law restrictiveness was employed to further 
explore the complex relationship between abortion policies and political engagement.

The analysis of the relationship between abortion policy and voter turnout rates revealed some 
significant findings with implications for the future of abortion politics in the United States. 
The linear regression revealed significant associations between abortion policy categories and 
voter turnout rates. States allowing legal abortion, as well as those with specific
gestational limits, exhibit notably higher voter turnout rates compared to states where abortion is
banned. The model, grounded in the most recent data, highlights the ongoing relevance of
abortion policy dynamics in shaping political participation.

Despite these insights, limitations such as the recency of the Dobbs decision and thus limited 
data and untested assumptions in the DiD method raise concerns about the robustness of the findings. 
Additionally, the lack of control for demographic variables and unexplored spillover effects 
highlight the need for further research to enhance methodological rigor and comprehensiveness in 
evaluating the impact of abortion policies on civic engagement. Addressing these limitations will
be crucial for a more accurate understanding of the future trajectoryof abortion politics and
electoral behavior in the United States.
